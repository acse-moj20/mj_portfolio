### About

I am an engineer/applied mathematician turned data scientist/engineer who likes to seek truth in data and feel strongly about the kind of work I am doing and the impact it has. I have significant eperience in most programming languages used in the data science industry including Python, SQL, C++ and C#.Net. Iam also adept at ML/AI packages across these languages such as Tensorflow, Pandas, pySpark, etc. My experience also covers the use of cloud technologies, CI/CD and somoe software development tools. Beyond technical skills, my strengths include time management, critical thinking, project delivery and completion, customer interaction and great communication skills.
